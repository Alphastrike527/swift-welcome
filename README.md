# Welcome!

We're excited to have you learn Swift and iOS development with us. There's a lot to cover in this course and the first couple of lessons in this track will revolve around getting you set up with the appropriate tools and platforms. Be prepared to spend some time on setup, but we promise it will be worth it because these will be the same tools and workflows that you will be using when you're building apps. So what can you expect in this and the subsequent lesson? 

- **Xcode**
- **GitHub**
- **Workflow for solving coding labs in this course**

Let's get started with Xcode. 

## What is Xcode?

Apple creates a lot of hardwarde such as the iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch & Apple TV. Powering these various devices is software. There are different pieces of software deployed on each device, names you might already be familiar with.

* iPhone- iOS
* Mac- MacOS
* Apple Watch- watchOS
* Apple TV- tvOS

But where do we create this software? For example, we can use a Word document to create essays, stories or other text based documents. For iOS development, Xcode serves as our Word document. It's a place where we write code.

The programming languages we can utilize within Xcode are Swift & Objective-C. When this code is written, we can then *run* the application. When doing so, Xcode is able to take the code we wrote and read it. It does more than read the code; it's able to compile it and allow any of the above devices to run it!

This process described above is known as an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Xcode then is the IDE provided by Apple that allows us to create apps.

## Installing Xcode

Download Xcode [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). You're required to download Xcode from the Mac App Store. So, after clicking the "View In mac App Store" link (see screenshot below) you should be directed to the Mac App Store where you can download the application.

* Once Xcode is installed, open it to make sure that everything is working OK. When opening the application, you should be presented with this screen (without all of those files listed in the right pane):

* Locate your Terminal application on your Mac. Pressing command + spacebar will bring up a search bar where you can begin to type in Terminal which is a fast way to locate the application (or any application for that matter!).

* Here is what my version of Terminal looks like when it's open. Yours might not look exactly like this, but you should be able to type in any commands you wish here.

* Type the following command in Terminal. Doing so should install the necessary packages. Many useful tools are included, such as the Apple LLVM compiler, linker, and Make.

`xcode-select --install`

In the next lesson, we'll get you set up on Github and walk you through the workflow of solving coding labs through Github and Xcode.
